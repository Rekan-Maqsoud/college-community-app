Comprehensive Assessment of the Higher Education Academic Hierarchy in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq: 2025–2026 Academic Cycle
1. Executive Summary and Systemic Overview
The higher education sector in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has entered a pivotal phase of standardization and expansion for the academic year 2025–2026. Governed by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MHE-KRG), the system is characterized by a dual-track progression: a robust, state-funded public university system that serves the majority of the student populace, and a rapidly growing private sector that emphasizes market-aligned specializations and international accreditations.
This report provides an exhaustive hierarchical delineation of these institutions, mapping the trajectory from University to College (Faculty) to Department. A critical variable in this analysis is the duration of study, which has seen strategic adjustments in 2025 due to the broader implementation of the Bologna Process across selected institutions. While the standard Bachelor’s degree remains a four-year commitment, professional degrees in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and architecture retain their five- to six-year structures to ensure compliance with federal Iraqi syndicates and international licensure standards.
The 2025–2026 academic landscape is also marked by the inauguration of specialized institutions, such as the Akre University of Applied Sciences, and the restructuring of polytechnic education to create clearer pathways between technical diplomas and bachelor's degrees. Furthermore, the "Zankoline" central admission system continues to act as the primary gatekeeper for public universities, processing student intakes based on Grade 12 baccalaureate performance, while private institutions operate under ministry-approved direct admission quotas.
2. Governmental (Public) Universities
The public university system remains the cornerstone of higher education in the Kurdistan Region. These institutions are tuition-free for standard admissions and are geographically distributed to ensure equitable access across the governorates of Erbil, Sulaimani, Duhok, and Halabja, as well as the independent administrations of Soran, Raparin, Garmian, and Zakho.
2.1 Salahaddin University-Erbil (SUE)
As the mother university of the region, Salahaddin University-Erbil (SUE) operates as the largest and most comprehensive academic entity. For the 2025–2026 academic year, SUE has notably reintegrated medical education into its portfolio, establishing a new College of Medicine to address the critical shortage of healthcare professionals in the expanding capital. This strategic move reverses the separation that occurred when Hawler Medical University was formed, marking a return to the comprehensive university model.
The university comprises 16 colleges offering a diverse array of undergraduate programs. The academic structure is heavily rooted in the four-year semester-based system, though
engineering and medical disciplines require longer tenures.

Insight: The introduction of the Molecular Genetics department within the College of Science highlights a shift towards biotechnology and advanced life sciences, responding to the post-pandemic necessity for genetic research capabilities within the public sector.
2.2 University of Sulaimani (UoS)
The University of Sulaimani acts as the intellectual hub of the Sulaymaniyah governorate. In the 2025–2026 academic year, UoS continues to maintain a rigorous academic standard, particularly in its medical and humanities colleges. The university's structure is distinct in its retention of a broad "School" and "Faculty" nomenclature in some contexts, although "College" remains the official administrative unit for ministry reporting.
The College of Commerce and the College of Environmental Sciences represent UoS's commitment to addressing specific regional challenges: economic diversification and climate change resilience.

The Kurdistan Region utilizes a dual-layer technical education system managed by three major polytechnic universities: Erbil (EPU), Sulaimani (SPU), and Duhok (DPU). These institutions oversee both Technical Colleges (granting 4-year Bachelor's degrees) and Technical Institutes (granting 2-year Diplomas). This structure allows for a vertical educational path, where top-performing diploma graduates can bridge into bachelor's programs.

6. Conclusion and Strategic Insights
The 2025–2026 academic data reveals a higher education sector in the Kurdistan Region that is simultaneously maturing and expanding. Key observations for stakeholders include:
1.
Standardization of Engineering: While Architecture remains a 5-year program across all institutions (Public and Private), other engineering disciplines like Civil and Software are standardized at 4 years, aligning with the Bologna process ECTS requirements.
2.
Medical Expansion: The monopoly of public universities on medical degrees has ended. The entry of Salahaddin University's new medical college and the robust medical faculties in private universities like Cihan and Knowledge indicates a market response to high demand.
3.
Emergence of Niche Tech: Departments such as Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Molecular Genetics are no longer fringe electives but fully established 4-year degree programs, reflecting a curriculum shift towards future-ready skills.
4.
Polytechnic Pathways: The clear distinction between 2-year Technical Institutes (Diploma) and 4-year Technical Colleges (Bachelor's) within the Polytechnic system provides a vital vocational ladder, distinct from the purely academic routes of traditional universities.
